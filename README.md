# AES Decryption

AES Descryption is an AESthetically pleasing web app which decrypts AES ciphertext. More specifically, it likes aes-256-cbc and Base64. The actual decryption is done on the client side using [CryptoJS][].

This was more of an exercise in web design than anything else, which is why it might appear to be slightly useless.

## Usage

Your best bet is OpenSSL: 

    $ openssl aes-256-cbc -base64 -in secrets -out secrets.aes

Use a strong [passphrase][pass] and then copy the contents of the file to your clipboard. Fire up [AES Decryption][aes], paste in the ciphertext, enter the passhrase, and click the decrypt button.
